This project is all about the Football club management & Scouting networks.It deals with the trading of players from different clubs, their purchases, selling, transefers etc. The club manager is responsible for all the recruitment of the players , he has right to buy scouts for the club too. Each club has their wedges depending on the current state of the club, this wedge amount changes as per the transaction between the clubs. The Owner (Admin) of the club has all the records on the daily basis so that he can analyze the future of the club.
